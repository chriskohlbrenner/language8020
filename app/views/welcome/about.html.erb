  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Experts in both <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/80-20-rule/">language learning</a> and <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/01/20/learning-language/">workflow efficiency</a> apply the Pareto principle, or the 80-20 rule, to learning a foreign language. That principle states that roughly 80% of outcomes result from only 20% of the inputs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/the-oec-facts-about-the-language">Oxford Dictionaries</a> estimates that just 10 different lemmas, or basic word forms, account for 25% of English language content. That figure jumps to 50% at 100 words and 75% at 1000. So why focus on complicated grammar and vocabulary when so few words comprise so much of our everyday communication?

  <p>
    This site displays the most common words in <%= Language.all.length %> languages, as gathered from sources like <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/">Open SubTitles</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists">Wiktionary frequency lists</a>. Users can test their knowledge of essential vocabulary by hovering over each word for the Google Translation to English.
